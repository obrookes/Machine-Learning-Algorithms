\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

% Topic 
% Purpose 
We wanted to develop a website which would help the students at the University of Bristol connect with each other in a social and academic context. As such, we decided to name our website the Bristol Social Network. The website comprises three main features, this includes the information board / forum, second hand market place and the society. These features are aimed at helping students find out information which could help broaden their social network. (Our Website: \url{ http://socialnetwork.aecmix.com/})

\section{Design Stage}
We separated the development of the website into two parts. Firstly, we focused on the basic features of the website such as the Login, Signup and static (pre-registration) about us pages. These allowed us to learn the basic skills required to fulfil the module's criteria but were necessary for the development of full-featured website. After the first stage of development was complete we focused on the more advanced features of the website (which were treated as an extension) such as messaging, automatic recommendation of friends and categorisation of products in the market place. The implementation of these features depended on the time which was remaining following the initial phase of the project.

A framework was considered for the development of this project because of the following reasons: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make cooperation more smooth since each developer is able to follow a specific design pattern
    \item Learn different design patterns within framework.
    \item Frameworks are widely used in industry. 
\end{enumerate}
However, the choice of the framework is important depending on the type of project. After the comparison of several different frameworks, the team decided to use React as the framework for the following three reasons: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It possesses many of the same features social network websites, such as Facebook (which uses React), possess. 
    \item It improves the user experience. For example, React allows for rapid response times as no refreshing is required. 
    \item It is one of the most popular the front-end frameworks available.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Work}
Due to time limitations the website we produced has most of the features we hoped to implement and functions as a basic social network website. However, there still are several aspects we can be improve on in the future.

Firstly, the website is responsive however there are some parts of the page which won't respond to the screen size of specific devices. Therefore, the page will be designed to support a wider range of devices.

Owing to the design of the forms the uploaded images weren't compressed slows down image loading. As such, further work will be undertaken to compress the images file uploaded by users. 
Furthermore, a social website should include a communication tool, such as a chat room. Socket will be considered for messaging and will be built in the future to enhance the functionality of the website. 
Lastly, the website is only registered with Http which is considered to be somewhat unsafe.
